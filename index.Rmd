Welcome to MEM5220 - Applied Econometrics. This handout is designed for the use with MEM5220 - Applied Econometrics at Tallinn University of Technology. Note that this workbook is still under heavy development!  

## Prerequisites {-}

A basic knowledge of the R [@team2013r] programming language  is required. 


In order to reproduce the examples in this script You need the statistical software package R. Additionally we recommend using the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) integrated developer environment (IDE) which will improve Your R working experience.

### Installation of R and RStudio  {-}

Go to the following webpages and download the software adequate for Your operating system:


1. [The Statistical Software Package R:](http://cran.r-project.org)
2. The GUI [RStudio:](https://www.rstudio.com)


Install R first and then proceed with RStudio. Afterwards start RStudio. For accessing packages and datasets from [github](https://github.com/) we need to install the **devtools** package. On Windows, download and install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), and devtools takes care of the rest. On Mac, install the Xcode command line tools. On Linux, install the R development package, usually called r-devel or r-base-dev. 


## Resources {-}


Our primary resource is @heiss2016using ^[Heiss (2016) builds on the popular Introductory Econometrics by Wooldridge (2016) and demonstrates how to replicate the applications discussed therein using R.]. The book is available as free [online](http://www.urfie.net/read.html) version. For theoretical concepts I refer to @wooldridge2015introductory^[[Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach](https://books.google.ee/books/about/Introductory_Econometrics_A_Modern_Appro.html?id=wUF4BwAAQBAJ&source=kp_cover&redir_esc=y).].  
For the timeseries part of the course a good reference material is  [Introductory Econometircs for Finance](https://www.cambridge.org/pt/academic/subjects/economics/finance/introductory-econometrics-finance-3rd-edition?format=PB&isbn=9781107661455). 

**Standing on the shoulders of giants**

This lecture material would not possible without many other open-source econometrics teaching materials and of course the R package developers. In addition to the main resources, examples and code of this workbook have been drawn from a number of free econometrics eBooks, blogs, R-vignette help pages and other researchers teaching materials. 

### Attribution {-}

Chapter 1.1.2 Simulating SLR is based on @heiss2016using but adds parts of @dalpiaz2016 and @colonescu2018 teaching materials. Chapter 1.2.2 includes additonal material from @Hanck2018.  Chapter 1.4 Heteroskedasticity has been amended with material from @Rodrigues2018 blog.

## Software information and conventions {-}


The R session information when compiling this book is shown below:

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

I do not add prompts (`>` and `+`) to R source code in this book, and I comment out the text output with two hashes `##` by default, as you can see from the R session information above. This is for your convenience when you want to copy and run the code (the text output will be ignored since it is commented out). Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and function arguments are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`). The double-colon operator `::` means accessing an object from a package. 
Content with **Note**, **Your turn** and **Overthinking** is surrounded by two horizontal lines. **Overthinking** sections serve as additional information for the interested reader but will not be covered in detail in class.
