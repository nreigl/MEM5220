This handout is designed for the use with MEM5220 - Applied Econometrics at [Tallinn University of Technology, Department of Economics and Finance](https://taltech.ee/en/department-economics-and-finance).   

## Prerequisites {-}

A basic knowledge of the R [@team2013r] programming language  is required. 


In order to reproduce the examples in this script you need the statistical software package R. Additionally I recommend using the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) integrated developer environment (IDE) which will improve your R working experience.

### Installation of R and RStudio  {-}

Go to the following webpages and download the software adequate for Your operating system:

1. [The Statistical Software Package R:](http://cran.r-project.org)
2. The GUI [RStudio:](https://www.rstudio.com)


Install R first and then proceed with RStudio. Afterwards start RStudio. For accessing packages and datasets from [github](https://github.com/) we need to install the **devtools** package. On Windows, download and install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), and devtools takes care of the rest. On Mac, install the Xcode command line tools. On Linux, install the R development package, usually called r-devel or r-base-dev. 


## Resources {-}


Our primary resource is @heiss2016using ^[Heiss (2016) builds on the popular Introductory Econometrics by Wooldridge (2016) and demonstrates how to replicate the applications discussed therein using R.]. The book is available as free [online](http://www.urfie.net/read.html) version. For theoretical concepts I refer to @wooldridge2015introductory^[[Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach](https://books.google.ee/books/about/Introductory_Econometrics_A_Modern_Appro.html?id=wUF4BwAAQBAJ&source=kp_cover&redir_esc=y).].  
For the timeseries part of the course a good reference material is  [Introductory Econometircs for Finance](https://www.cambridge.org/pt/academic/subjects/economics/finance/introductory-econometrics-finance-3rd-edition?format=PB&isbn=9781107661455). 



### Attribution {-}

This lecture material would not possible without many other open-source econometrics teaching materials and of course the R package developers. In addition to the main resources, examples and code of this workbook have been drawn from a number of free econometrics eBooks, blogs, R-vignette help pages and other researchers teaching materials. 

Chapter 1.1.2 Simulating SLR is based on @heiss2016using but adds parts of @dalpiaz2016 and @colonescu2018 teaching materials. Chapter 1.2.2 includes additional material from @Hanck2018.  Chapter 1.4 Heteroskedasticity has been amended with material from @Rodrigues2018 blog. The time series part is closely related to the teaching material of Andres Vörk. The finite distributed lags model is adapted from Constantin Colonescu.

## Updates {-}

For a brief rundown of the version history, we have:

### Version 3.1.0. {-}

I released the 3.1.0 version of this teaching material in March 15, 2021. 

 - Cleanup of certain outdated functions (dplyr::arrange)
 - Remove `renv`
 - Add quantile regression subsection to LM.Rmd
 - Add heteroskedasdicity simulations 

Known bugs: 

 - Line 2267 in LM.Rmd: `waldtest` fails to compile in the bookdown version but works in the script version


## Software information and conventions {-}


The R session information when compiling this book is shown below:

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F, results = "hide"}
pacman::p_unload(pacman::p_loaded(), character.only = TRUE)
```


I do not add prompts (`>` and `+`) to R source code in this book, and I comment out the text output with two hashes `##` by default, as you can see from the R session information above. This is for your convenience when you want to copy and run the code (the text output will be ignored since it is commented out).

* R code blocks and their output appear in a gray background. E.g., 

```{r}
2 + 2 == 5
```

* Functions and inline code are in a typewriter font and followed by parentheses, all atop a gray background (e.g., `brm()`).

* When I want to make explicit the package a given function comes from, I insert the double-colon operator `::` between the package name and the function (e.g., `tidybayes::mode_hdi()`).

Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**). Content with **Note**, **Your turn** and **Overthinking** is surrounded by two horizontal lines. **Overthinking** sections serve as additional information for the interested reader but will not be covered in detail in class.
