# Introduction 

Welcome to MEM5220 - Applied Econometrics. This handout was originally (and currently) designed for the use with MEM5220 - Applied Econometrics at Tallinn University of Technology. Note that this workbook is still under heavy development!  

## Prerequisites

A basic knowledge of the R [@team2013r] programming language  is required. 


## Resources

Our primary resource is @heiss2016using ^[Heiss (2016) builds on the popular Introductory Econometrics by Wooldridge (2016) and demonstrates how to replicate the applications discussed therein using R.]
. For theoretical concepts see @wooldridge2015introductory.
