This handout is designed for the use with MEM5220 - Applied Econometrics at Tallinn University of Technology. Note that this workbook is still under heavy development! Prerequisites A basic knowledge of the R (Team 2013) programming language is required. In order to reproduce the examples in this script You need the statistical software package R. Additionally we recommend using the RStudio integrated developer environment (IDE) which will improve Your R working experience. Installation of R and RStudio Go to the following webpages and download the software adequate for Your operating system: The Statistical Software Package R: The GUI RStudio: Install R first and then proceed with RStudio. Afterwards start RStudio. For accessing packages and datasets from github we need to install the devtools package. On Windows, download and install Rtools, and devtools takes care of the rest. On Mac, install the Xcode command line tools. On Linux, install the R development package, usually called r-devel or r-base-dev. Resources Our primary resource is Heiss (2016).1 The book is available as free online version. For theoretical concepts I refer to Wooldridge (2015)2. For the timeseries part of the course a good reference material is Introductory Econometircs for Finance. Standing on the shoulders of giants This lecture material would not possible without many other open-source econometrics teaching materials and of course the R package developers. In addition to the main resources, examples and code of this workbook have been drawn from a number of free econometrics eBooks, blogs, R-vignette help pages and other researchers teaching materials. Attribution Chapter 1.1.2 Simulating SLR is based on Heiss (2016) but adds parts of Dalpiaz (2016) and Colonescu (2018) teaching materials. Chapter 1.2.2 includes additonal material from Hanck et al. (2018). Chapter 1.4 Heteroskedasticity has been amended with material from Rodrigues (2018) blog. The time series part is closely related to the teaching material of Andres Vörk. The fininte distributed lags model is adepted from Constantin Colonescu. Using R for Introduction to Econometrics, Hanck et al. (2018) Applied Statistics with R, Dalpiaz (2016) Principles of Econometrics with R, Colonescu (2018) Introduction to Econometrics with R, Oswald and Robin (2018) Broadening Your Statistical Horizons Software information and conventions The R session information when compiling this book is shown below: sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit) ## Running under: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib ## LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib ## ## locale: ## [1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] compiler_4.0.2 magrittr_2.0.1 bookdown_0.21 tools_4.0.2 ## [5] htmltools_0.5.0 rstudioapi_0.13 yaml_2.2.1 stringi_1.5.3 ## [9] rmarkdown_2.5 highr_0.8 knitr_1.30 stringr_1.4.0 ## [13] xfun_0.19 digest_0.6.27 rlang_0.4.9 evaluate_0.14 I do not add prompts (&gt; and +) to R source code in this book, and I comment out the text output with two hashes ## by default, as you can see from the R session information above. This is for your convenience when you want to copy and run the code (the text output will be ignored since it is commented out). Package names are in bold text (e.g., rmarkdown), and inline code and function arguments are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., bookdown::render_book()). The double-colon operator :: means accessing an object from a package. Content with Note, Your turn and Overthinking is surrounded by two horizontal lines. Overthinking sections serve as additional information for the interested reader but will not be covered in detail in class. Acknowledgements I thank Kadri Männasoo and Juan Carlos Cuestas for proofreading and their useful comments. Heiss (2016) builds on the popular Introductory Econometrics by Wooldridge (2016) and demonstrates how to replicate the applications discussed therein using R.↩︎ Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach.↩︎ "]]
